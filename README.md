# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissor game for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) or [this](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors) ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text!
